# The MusicExplorationApp - Explore Spotify Artists Displayed as a Map
Recommender systems, like the one Spotify uses, tend to be opaque and donâ€™t show users how recommendations are calculated or how they relate to the rest of the items in a dataset.

To tackle this, I present the MusicExplorationApp. This web application uses a map metaphor to show users where their preferences and recommendations are located on a map of music. In addition, this map can be used to explore a space of about 9 000 artists.
