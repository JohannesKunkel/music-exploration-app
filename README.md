# The MusicExplorationApp - Explore Spotify Music with an Interactive Map
Recommender systems, like the one Spotify uses, tend to be opaque and don’t show users how recommendations are calculated or how they relate to the rest of the items in a dataset.

To tackle this, I present the MusicExplorationApp. This web application uses a map metaphor to show users where their preferences and recommendations are located on a map of music. In addition, this map can be used to explore a space of about 9 000 artists.

A journal article about the MusicExplorationApp and a user study we conducted is currently under review. The supplementary material of this experiment can be found at:
